## 10.3.1: Read the DNA data:
We’ll use DNA data from the NIH of two p53 genes, from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000017.11?report=fasta&from=7668402&to=7687550&strand=true) and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000017.11?report=fasta&from=7668402&to=7687550&strand=true).

Note that DNA is composed of four bases: cytosine ( C ), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T). These bases, when read together, produce instructions that the organism can follow in order to create useful things. We represent the connected sequence of bases in a text file with a single letter per base.

Implement the function ```read_file(filename)``` included in the starter file. Given a filename, read the text from that file into a variable. Remove any newlines (‘\n’) from the text, then return it. When called on a DNA file, this will return a string holding all the DNA in the file.

```python
def read_file(filename):
    f = open(filename, 'r')
    result = ""
    for line in f:
        line = line.rstrip('\n')
        result += line
    f.close()
    return result
```
