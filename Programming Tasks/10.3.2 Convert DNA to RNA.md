## 10.3.2: Convert DNA to RNA:
Next, you need to convert the DNA string to a string of RNA, which will be used to follow the instructions of the DNA. However, this process is not done by reading all of the DNA string. Instead, the organism breaks down the DNA into groups of three bases (called codons). One codon, ATG, signals the Start of an RNA strand; three other codons (TAA, TAG, and TGA) signal the end (Stop).

Implement the function ```dna_to_rna(dna, start_index)``` included in the starter file. You can assume that the start point for the RNA has already been found (start_index); your task is to read codons from that start point until the end point is found, and return a list of all the codons in between. To do this, loop through the DNA sequence and produce codons as you go, by combining together every three DNA bases in a row into a codon. Add each codon to a list as a three-character string. As soon as you have added a Stop codon (or run out of DNA bases to read), return the list of codons.

One final note- for a variety of reasons, RNA uses U as a base instead of T. You’ll need to replace every T base you find with a U instead. This means you’ll need to check for Stop codons UAA, UAG, and UGA.

```python
def dna_to_rna(dna, start_index):
    dna = dna[start_index:]         # slice dna based on starting index
    dna = dna.replace('T', 'U')     # replace each T base to U base
    codon = ""                      # create an empty codon
    codon_list = []                 # create an empty codon list

    # loop through entire dna sequence
    for char in dna:
        # build a single codon
        if (len(codon) < 3):            # combine 3 bases to a codon
            codon += char               # build codon with chars
        
        # append codon to list
        if (len(codon) == 3):
            codon_list.append(codon)    # append codon to codon_list
            if (codon == "UAA" or       # check for stop codons
                codon == "UAG" or
                codon == "UGA"):
                return codon_list       # return list with stop codon
            codon = ""  # reset codon string

    return codon_list   # return list with no stop codon
