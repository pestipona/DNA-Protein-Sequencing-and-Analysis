## 10.3.3: Make a Codon Dictionary:
To turn RNA into proteins, we’ll need to know which amino acid each codon corresponds to. We’ve provided this information in the file data/codon_table.json, which is included for you here. Unfortunately, this data is not formatted exactly as you need it to be; it maps amino acids to lists of codons, but you need to map each codon to an amino acid instead.

Implement the function ```make_codon_dictionary()``` in the starter file. First, read the contents of the json file into a dictionary by opening the given filename and calling the library method json.load on the file. Then use the loaded dictionary (which maps amino acids to lists of codons) to generate a new dictionary (which will map codons to amino acids). Make sure to change all Ts in the codons to Us as you do this!

```python
import json

def make_codon_dictionary(filename):
    # open the JSON file
    f = open(filename, 'r')

    # return JSON object as a dictionary
    dict_old = json.load(f)

    # create a new empty dict to store codons to amino acids
    dict_new = dict()

    # iterate through the old dictionary
    for key in dict_old:
        # iterate through each codon in the list
        for codon in dict_old[key]:
            # change all T's to U's in the Codon
            codon = codon.replace('T', 'U')
            # add codon & amino-acid value pair to dict
            dict_new[codon] = key

    # return new dictionary
    return dict_new
```
