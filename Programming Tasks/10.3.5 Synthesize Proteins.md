## 10.3.5: Synthesize Proteins:
Finally, we need to put all of the previous steps together in order to synthesize proteins from our data file. This is where we start processing real data!

Implement the function ```synthesize_proteins(dna_filename, codon_filename)``` in the starter file. This program should read the DNA from the given filename (using read_file) and produce a codon dictionary by calling ```make_codon_dictionary```.

The program should then identify all of the RNA strands that can be produced from the DNA by iterating through all the indexes in the DNA string, looking for the start code (ATG) at each point. Note that you’ll need to keep track of a list of proteins and a count variable outside of the loop.

If you identify an index in the DNA that corresponds to ATG, call dna_to_rna starting from that index to extract the entire RNA sequence, then call generate_protein on the resulting RNA (and codon dictionary) to produce a protein. That protein should be added to an overall protein list. Then update the index in the DNA strand to skip past all the already-checked bases (by adding 3 * the length of the RNA strand).
If you get to an index that does not correspond to ATG, move on to the next base.

When you finish looping, you’ll have a list of all the proteins synthesized from the DNA. Return that as your final result.

```python
def synthesize_proteins(dna_filename, codon_filename):
    # read the dna file
    dna = read_file(dna_filename)

    # create codon dictionary
    codon_dictionary = make_codon_dictionary(codon_filename)

    # create empty protein list to protein sequence
    proteins = []

    # creat place value holders
    index = 0
    num_codons = 0
    num_bases = len(dna)

    # iterate through the dna string
    while(index < len(dna)):
        # check if codon is ATG
        if dna[index:index+3] == "ATG":
            # create rna list based on dna
            rna = dna_to_rna(dna, index)
            # get number of codons in the rna list
            num_codons = num_codons + len(rna)
            # update new index value
            index = index + len(rna)*3
            # create protein list based on rna and dict
            protein = generate_protein(rna, codon_dictionary)
            # append to proteins list
            proteins.append(protein)
        else:
            index = index + 1

    unused_bases = num_bases - num_codons*3
    syn_proteins = len(proteins)

    print("There are", num_bases, "total bases,")
    print(unused_bases, "unused bases,", "and", syn_proteins, "synthesized proteins")

    # return list of protein sequences
    return proteins
```
