## 10.5.1: Find Common Proteins:

First, you need to determine if there are any proteins that occur in both genes, and what those proteins are. This will help determine how similar the two genes actually are.

Implement the function ```common_proteins(protein_list1, protein_list2)``` in the starter file. This function takes two lists of proteins (where each protein is a list of amino acids) and returns a list of all the unique proteins that occur in both lists. Each protein should only occur once in the result list, even if it shows up multiple times in both genes.

```python
def common_proteins(protein_list1, protein_list2):
    # create blank list for storing common proteins
    common = []

    # compare both input list1 and list2
    for i in protein_list1:
        # go through each item in list2
        for j in protein_list2:
            # compare the amino acids in list1 & list2
            if (i == j and i not in common):
                # add item to the list
                common.append(i)
                
    return common
```
