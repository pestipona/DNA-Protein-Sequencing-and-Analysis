## 10.5.2: Combine Protein Lists:

It turns out that there aren’t many proteins in common between our two genes at all. Therefore, it’s more interesting for us to consider what the biggest differences between the two genes are. More specifically, we want to compare the amino acids generated by the two genes, to see if anything in particular occurs more often in humans than elephants, or vice versa.

To do this comparison, we first need to collapse the list of proteins into a list of the amino acids that occur across all the proteins. Implement the function ```combine_proteins(protein_list)``` that takes a list of proteins (where each protein is a list of amino acid strings) and returns a list of all the amino acids that occur across all the proteins, in their original order. In other words, this function inputs a 2D list of strings and outputs a 1D list of strings.

```python
def combine_proteins(protein_list):
    # create blank list for storing combine proteins
    combine = []

    # combine together both lists
    # go through each sublist in protein_list:
    for sub_list in protein_list:
        # go through each codon in the sublist
        for codon in sub_list:
            combine.append(codon)

    return combine
```
