## 10.5.3: Generate Amino Acid Dictionary:

Once we have a list of amino acids, we can use it to generate a dictionary that maps each amino acid in the list to a count of how often it occurs. Weâ€™ll use this dictionary to determine the frequencies of each amino acid- how common is each type in the gene?

Implement the function ```amino_acid_dictionary(aa_list)``` in the starter file. This takes a list of amino acids (strings), aa_list, and returns a dictionary that maps each amino acid to how often it occurs in the list.

```python
def amino_acid_dictionary(aa_list):
    # create blank dict for storing occurrences
    d = dict()
    # create blank list for keys
    keys = []

    # go through the protein list
    for amino_acid in aa_list:
        if amino_acid not in keys:
            keys.append(amino_acid)

    # get the occurrence for each key
    for key in keys:
        x = aa_list.count(key)
        d[key] = x

    return d
```
