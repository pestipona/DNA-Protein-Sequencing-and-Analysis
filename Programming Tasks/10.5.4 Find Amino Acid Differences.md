## 10.5.4: Find Amino Acid Differences:

Now that we know how common each amino acid is, we can start comparing amino acids between genes of different lengths. Because the genes have different lengths, we canâ€™t just compare the counts of amino acids. Instead, weâ€™ll compare the frequencies of amino acids- in other words, how frequently it occurs in the gene. We can determine the frequency of an amino acid by finding its count (from amino_acid_dictionary) and dividing it by the total number of amino acids in the gene.

### Implement the function
```find_amino_acid_differences(protein_list1, protein_list2, cutoff)``` in the starter file. This takes two protein lists and a float cutoff and returns a list of three-element lists, where the first element in the list is an amino acid, the second element is the frequency of that amino acid in protein_list1, and the third element is the frequency of that amino acid in protein_list2. You should only include amino acids in this returned list if the difference between their frequencies is greater than the provided cutoff. This cutoff is given as a decimal- in other words, 0.02 is 2%. You should also not include the Start and Stop amino acids in the list, as they are not interesting for this analysis (though they should still count towards the overall length of the gene).

To generate this list, you should first use your combine_proteins and amino_acid_dictionary functions to generate data about amino acid frequencies for each protein list. Then go through each amino acid in the lists, and add each amino acid if and only if the two frequencies are sufficiently different between the two genes. If an amino acid does not occur in one of the two lists, its frequency is 0.

```python
def find_amino_acid_differences(protein_list1, protein_list2, cutoff):
    # create combined proteins in each list
    combined_list1 = combine_proteins(protein_list1)
    combined_list2 = combine_proteins(protein_list2)

    # create dictionary of occurrences for each list
    occur_dict1 = amino_acid_dictionary(combined_list1)
    occur_dict2 = amino_acid_dictionary(combined_list2)

    # create dictionary of frequency for each list
    freq_dict1 = dict()
    freq_dict2 = dict()

    # create list of keys for each list
    keys1 = occur_dict1.keys()
    keys2 = occur_dict2.keys()

    # create list of values & sum for each list
    values1 = occur_dict1.values()
    sum1 = 0
    for value in values1:
        sum1 += value

    values2 = occur_dict2.values()
    sum2 = 0
    for value in values2:
        sum2 += value

    # populate frequency dictionaries
    for key in keys1:
        frequency = occur_dict1[key] / sum1
        freq_dict1[key] = frequency

    for key in keys2:
        frequency = occur_dict2[key] / sum2
        freq_dict2[key] = frequency

    # do not include "Start" and "Stop" amino acids
    freq_dict1.pop("Start")
    freq_dict1.pop("Stop")
    freq_dict2.pop("Start")
    freq_dict2.pop("Stop")

    # get set intersection of both lists
    set1 = set(keys1)
    set2 = set(keys2)
    set3 = set1.intersection(set2)

    # add amino acids that are common in both (intersection):
    sublist = []
    superlist = []
    for amino in set3:
        if amino in freq_dict1 and amino in freq_dict2:
            diff = abs(freq_dict1[amino] - freq_dict2[amino])
            if diff > cutoff:
                sublist.append(amino)
                sublist.append(freq_dict1[amino])
                sublist.append(freq_dict2[amino])
                superlist.append(sublist)
            sublist = []

    # add amino acids that don't occur in list2
    set1_diff = set1.difference(set2)
    sublist = []
    for amino in set1_diff:
        if freq_dict1[amino] > cutoff:
            sublist.append(amino)
            sublist.append(freq_dict1[amino])
            sublist.append(0)
            superlist.append(sublist)

    # add amino acids that don't occur in list1
    set2_diff = set2.difference(set1)
    sublist = []
    for amino in set2_diff:
        if freq_dict2[amino] > cutoff:
