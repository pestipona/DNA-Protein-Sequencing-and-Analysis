## 10.5.6: Generate Differences Text Report:

Finally, you should print out the most different amino acids. The function ```display_differences(differences)``` takes a differences list (produced by find_amino_acid_differences) and prints out the included amino acid information (with amino acids sorted in alphabetical order), returning None. To make this information readable, first print the amino acid; then print the percentage frequency in the first sequence (rounded to two decimal points); then print the percentage frequency in the second sequence (rounded to two decimal points).

Given the differences produced by the two gene files, this function should print out:

* Arg: 6.01% in Seq1, 4.63% in Seq2
* Gly: 7.4% in Seq1, 6.66% in Seq2
* Ile: 3.07% in Seq1, 2.46% in Seq2
* Lys: 4.96% in Seq1, 4.2% in Seq2
* Met: 2.13% in Seq1, 3.09% in Seq2
* Phe: 3.98% in Seq1, 5.26% in Seq2
* Thr: 4.02% in Seq1, 4.82% in Seq2
* Tyr: 2.06% in Seq1, 2.6% in Seq2

Again, to pass the test case, your printed text must match our format exactly!

```python
def display_differences(differences):

    # print out results
    for proteins in differences:
        amino_acid = proteins[0]
        diff_1 = "{:.2%}".format(proteins[1])
        diff_2 = "{:.2%}".format(proteins[2])
        print(amino_acid, ":", diff_1, "in Seq1,", diff_2, "in Seq2")

    return
```
