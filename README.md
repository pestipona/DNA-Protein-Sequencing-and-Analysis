# DNA-Protein-Sequencing-and-Analysis

## I. Introduction:
In this project, you will see how python is used to perform data analysis in processing and analyzing DNA sequences for the p53 gene, which is used to suppress cancer in organisms. The p53 genes in humans and elephants will be compared, to identify what they have in common and how they are different.

The first step involves interpretation of DNA data files from the NIH, convert them to RNA, then convert that to a sequence of generated proteins. This will then be compared to the DNA data of the two organisms to discover their similarities and differences.

## 10.2: Part I Instructions:
In the first stage of the project, DNA data will be read, converted to RNA, and then convert that to a sequence of proteins. During this process an output will be generated on how many bases exist in each sequence, how many of those bases are actually used, and how many proteins are synthesized from the sequence.

## 10.4: Part II Instructions:

In the second stage of this project, the protein sequences generated in the first stage will be analyzed, to determine what the biggest commonalities and biggest differences are between the two sequences. A text report will be produced to showcase these results.
